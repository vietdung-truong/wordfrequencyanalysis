# Word Frequency Analysis

This script performs word frequency analysis on text from a file or URL.

## Usage

To perform word frequency analysis, run the script with the following command:

```sh
python word_frequency.py <input_file_or_url>
```

Replace `<input_file_or_url>` with the path to your text file or the URL you want to analyze.

```

This will output the word frequency analysis for the text in `sample.txt`.

## URL List

You can also provide a list of URLs in a text file, with each URL on a new line. The script will process each URL and perform word frequency analysis.

### Example URL List

```
http://example.com/text1
http://example.com/text2
```

Run the script with the URL list:
